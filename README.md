> This project is suited for designers and frontend developers who are interested in typography and design systems. Itâ€™s particularly relevant if youâ€™re a designer looking to understand more about the code side of design systems, and you want to make it easier for public services to use more distinctive typography on their websites.

# USWDS Custom Theme Typefaces
The purpose of this project is to provide theme settings and related files to make it easier to incorporate some of the best [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) typefaces into your [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) sites and expand the typographic diversity of the gov site ecosystem


## Check it out

1. [Open uswds-custom-theme-typefaces in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/pglevy/uswds-custom-theme-typefaces) to run the project.

1. Uncomment one of these @forward statements in `assets/uswds/dist/theme/styles.scss` and refresh the preview site to see the site with that typeface.

```
// @forward "typeface-libre-baskerville";
// @forward "typeface-lora";
// @forward "typeface-poppins";
@forward "uswds";
@forward "uswds-theme-custom-styles";
```

You can also view the type specimen page, which is currently the [homepage for the compiled site](https://pglevy.github.io/uswds-custom-theme-typefaces/) hosted here on GitHub Pages.

## How to add to your project

### 1. Copy settings tokens

If you're already using theme settings (in a `_uswds-theme.scss` file, for example), copy the token settings content from one of the typeface files (for example: `assets/uswds/dist/theme/_typeface-lora.scss`). Be sure to leave out the `@use "uswds-core" with` because it's already in your theme file.

If you're not using other theme settings, you can alternatively add one of these @forward statements to your `styles.scss` file (or whatever your main sass file is).

```
// @forward "typeface-libre-baskerville";
// @forward "typeface-lora";
// @forward "typeface-poppins";
@forward "uswds-theme";
@forward "uswds";
@forward "uswds-theme-custom-styles";
```

### 2. Copy font files

Copy the files for the typefaces you want to use from `assets/uswds/dist/fonts/custom`. If you put them in a different place in your project, update the `dir` setting in the `$theme-font-serif-custom-src` token.
